# web-scraping-challenge

## Background

This assignment involves building a web application that scrapes the latest data from four different websites that contain data in relation to Mars and displays the information in a HTML page. 

## Tools Used

Jupyter Notebook, Python, HTML, CSS

## Resources

Bootstrap

## Instructions

Step 1: Run scrape_mars.py in Terminal and the scraped data from the websites will be returned as a dictionary (mars_dict).

Step 2: Run app.py in Terminal. Open url in output to view the HTML page containing the data scraped in Step 1.

Step 3: In the open HTML page, click the button 'Scrape New Data' to run a fresh scrape and update the HTML page with the freshly scraped data.

Note: the scraping code was developed and tested in Jupyter Notebook - see file mission_to_mars.ipynb. If you get an error for chromedriver.exe (included in thsi repository), the version may differ from that of your Chrome version - if this occurs, download the correct chromedriver.exe. The files index.html and style.css and stored in the 'templates' folder. The screenshots of the final application are contained in the 'images' folder.
